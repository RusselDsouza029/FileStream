# FileStream: A Feature-Rich File Management Application

This React.js application showcases my skills in front-end development, user interface design, and database integration (See commit: <hash>). FileStream leverages Supabase for a robust backend and Firebase for secure hosting, providing a seamless user experience.

## Key Features:

- Personalized Account Management: Update your profile picture and manage account details
- Customizable Themes: Tailor the FileStream interface to your preferences by selecting a theme that suits your style

## Technologies Used:
- React.js (Front-end Development)
- Framer Motion (UI Animation)
- Supabase (Backend as a Service)
- Firebase (Hosting and Security)
- SCSS (Styling Preprocessor)

## What This Project Demonstrates:
- Proficiency in building modern web applications with React.js
- Ability to design a user-friendly and interactive interface
- Integration with Supabase for efficient data management
- Secure deployment with Firebase
